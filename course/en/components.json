      "inlineTranscriptBody": "<p>The clinical management guidelines were initially developed in 2008 when optometrists were first granted independent prescribing status due to changes in legislation and amendments to the human medicines regulations. These changes are underpinned by the provision of published guidance to support optometrists to prescribe safely and effectively within their scope of practice.</p><p>However, they're also used by other health professionals such as GPs, nurses, and pharmacists. While they're not exhausted at present, the CMGs enable optometrists to make evidence-based clinical decisions on the diagnosis and treatment over 60 common and rare eye conditions that may present in practice. Each CMG is structured in a standardized format, covering condition, aetiology, risk factors, patient presentation differential, and management advice, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological, and also setting up the quality and strength of that evidence.</p><p>For each of these recommendations, the CMGs are written and updated regularly by a team of optometrists and ophthalmologists following a nice approved external peer review process. The first step to update the CMGs is to formulate search terms based on a series of clinical questions. For example, questions on therapeutic interventions are always based in terms of patient intervention, comparator and outcome, known as the P PICO framework. </p><p>For example, In children with bacterial conjunctivitis, is chloramphenicol more effective than placebo in bringing about a faster resolution? In this case, children with bacterial conjunctivitis would be the P or patient. Chloramphenicol is the I or intervention. Placebo is the C or comparator, and faster resolution is the O or outcome appropriate.</p><p>The quality of the evidence for each clinical question is determined after considering the study design, consistency and applicability of the evidence to the target population and is rated by the high, medium, or low, with high meaning any further research is unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of any treatment effects. However, the grade system allows for upgrading observational study or downgrading a randomized controlled trial using specific criteria where appropriate.</p><p>The strength of the evidence is graded by strong or weak based upon the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, the quality of the evidence and variability or uncertainty about patient values and preferences.</p><p>That's where the writing team are confident that most patients would benefit from a particular treatment or management strategy. A strong rating is given if there's uncertainty regarding the magnitude of treatment effects or risks and benefits are finely balanced, then a risk, then a weak rating is given.</p><p>Once updated the CMG draft is then sent out for peer review to three groups. The CMG reference group, the Independent Prescribing Review group, and the public and patients reference group feedback is collated and considered to refine the drafts before a final version with track changes is sent to the College's Education and Standards Committee for review and approval. Only once the queries are addressed is approval granted before publication on the college website. The CMGs are publicly available on our website, but also available on the College app, which is currently only accessible to College members.</p>",

The second element is the patient, which includes their values and their personal preferences. The third element is you, the clinician, taking into account your experience and your judgment.",
